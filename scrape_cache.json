In 2026, global spending on artificial intelligence is expected to approach half a trillion dollars, with companies like Nvidia leading the charge as it recently became the first firm valued at $5 trillion. This surge includes massive investments in data centers anticipated to consume more power than several major American cities combined. However, questions remain about whether AI\u2019s promise of miraculous breakthroughs and automation will ever justify these enormous costs or if the current boom resembles past financial bubbles like those in 1929 or 2000. Understanding this dynamic is essential for assessing the risks and opportunities beneath the hype and what it means for the economy and everyday people.

The show was visible even near the U.S.-Mexico border under city lights, surprising many viewers. This aurora event was triggered by intense solar wind interacting with Earth's magnetic field, creating stronger and more widespread light emissions than usual. Such storms can affect satellite and communication systems but also provide rare viewing opportunities for people in low-latitude areas. This event highlights how solar activity can extend the reach of aurora displays significantly beyond expected zones.
