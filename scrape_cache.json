      "full_text": "UK will give sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius\n\n3 October 2024 Share Save Andrew Harding BBC correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe UK has announced it is giving up sovereignty of a remote but strategically important cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean after more than half a century. The deal \u2013 reached after years of negotiations - will see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. This includes the tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, used by the US government as a military base for its navy ships and long-range bomber aircraft. The announcement, made in a joint statement by the UK and Mauritian Prime Ministers, ends decades of often fractious negotiations between the two countries.\n\nThe US-UK base will remain on Diego Garcia \u2013 a key factor enabling the deal to go forward at a time of growing geopolitical rivalries in the region between Western countries, India, and China. The BBC visits the secretive Chagos Islands military base\n\nUN says UK military island not suitable for stranded migrants\n\nUK commitment to Falklands 'unwavering' despite Chagos deal The deal is still subject to finalisation of a treaty, but both sides have promised to complete it as quickly as possible. \"This is a seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law,\" the statement from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth read. The leaders also said they were committed \"to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security\". The treaty will also \"address wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to support the welfare of Chagossians\". UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the benefits of the deal included closing \"a potential illegal migration route\". Dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils have been held in a fenced camp on the island for three years as complex legal battles are waged over their fate. It is unclear what the announcement will mean for them. The UK will provide a package of financial support to Mauritius, including annual payments and infrastructure investment. Mauritius will also be able to begin a programme of resettlement on the Chagos Islands, but not on Diego Garcia. There, the UK will ensure operation of the military base for \"an initial period\" of 99 years. US President Joe Biden welcomed the \"historic agreement\", saying it was a \"clear demonstration that through diplomacy and partnership, countries can overcome long-standing historical challenges to reach peaceful and mutually beneficial outcomes\". He said it secured the future of a key military base which \"plays a vital role in national, regional, and global security.\" The Chagos islanders themselves \u2013 some in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others living in Crawley in Sussex \u2013 do not speak with one voice on the fate of their homeland. Some are determined to return to live on the isolated islands, some are more focused on their rights and status in the UK, while others argue that the archipelago\u2019s status should not be resolved by outsiders. Isabelle Charlot, speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, said the deal brought back hopes her family could return to her father's island \"roots\". Plans for the Mauritius government to arrange resettlement would mean a \"place that we can call home - where we will be free,\" she said. But Frankie Bontemps, a second generation Chagossian in the UK, told the BBC that he felt \"betrayed\" and \"angry\" at the news because \"Chagossians have never been involved\" in the negotiations. \"We remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future\", he said, and called for the full inclusion of Chagossians in drafting the treaty.\n\nGetty Images The US-UK military operate a highly-secretive base from one of the islands, Diego Garcia\n\nIn recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies, including its top court and general assembly, overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\". The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968. At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base. Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.

      "full_text": "Rejoice, for the year of 2025 is finally over.\n\nDuring our planet\u2019s latest and seemingly interminable revolution around the Sun, the tech industry\u2019s obsession with AI soared to ever more implausible heights. CEOs began openly gloating about replacing their underlings with AI \u201cagents.\u201d The phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis became a national news story as more people were seemingly driven over the edge by their silver-tongued chatbot companions. \u201cSlop\u201d took on a new meaning. And the word \u201ccircular\u201d suddenly started being used a whole lot in the same sentence as \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d or even \u201chundreds of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nWill 2026 finally deliver us from this endless cavalcade of large language model madness? Not likely, according to computer scientist and \u201cgodfather\u201d of AI Geoffrey Hinton. AI will only continue to improve next year, he predicts, reaching a point where it will liberate us from all our horrible low-paying jobs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see AI get even better,\u201d Hinton said during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s already extremely good. We\u2019re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It\u2019s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it\u2019s going to be able to replace many other jobs.\u201d\n\nHinton was one of three recipients of the prestigious Turing Award in 2018 for his work on neural networks that formed the bedrock of modern AI, earning him the moniker of being a \u201cgodfather\u201d of the field.\n\nIn 2023, Hinton declared that he regretted his life\u2019s work after stepping down from his role at Google, where he had been for over a decade. Since then, he\u2019s become one of the tech\u2019s most prominent doomsayers.\n\nDuring the CNN interview, Hinton was asked whether he was more or less worried about AI since making that now infamous declaration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably more worried,\u201d Hinton replied. \u201cIt\u2019s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it\u2019s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.\u201d\n\nAI is progressing so quickly, according to Hinton, that around every seven months it can complete tasks that took twice as long before. He predicted that it\u2019s only a matter of years until an AI will effortlessly perform software engineering tasks that take a human a month to complete.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,\u201d Hinton added.\n\nHinton made similarly gloomy predictions in a talk with Senator Bernie Sanders last month, saying that tech leaders are \u201cbetting on AI replacing a lot of workers.\u201d\n\nIt still remains to be seen, though, if AI will actually make those strides. Many efforts to replace workers with semi-autonomous AI models have failed, while some new models, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5, showed only lackluster improvements.\n\nMore on AI: After Outcry, Firefox Promises \u201cKill Switch\u201d That Turns Off All AI Features",

      "full_text": "It\u2019s official: OpenAI is now a bona fide for-profit corporation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ChatGPT maker announced that it had restructured its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation, a type of corporate entity whose ostensible mission is to serve the public good while \u2014 crucially \u2014 generating loads of profit.\n\nThe move completes the company\u2019s metamorphosis: from its origins as a nonprofit devoted to developing open source AI technology for the betterment of humankind to the closed-source, profit-seeking juggernaut that it is today, with its staggering half-trillion dollar valuation reflecting the ominously outsized influence it has on the global economy.\n\nThe company\u2019s nonprofit arm, now called the \u201cOpenAI Foundation,\u201d will remain in control of the for-profit arm, rebranded OpenAI Group PBC. But as part of the restructuring, the nonprofit will receive a 26 percent stake in the public benefit corporation equal to $130 billion. Down the line, this also allows OpenAI to list itself on the stock market, generating an even more immense valuation than it currently enjoys.\n\nThe restructuring has been over a year and a half in the making, with OpenAI\u2019s longtime patron Microsoft \u2014 as well as its rival Elon Musk, who helped cofound OpenAI with CEO Sam Altman before departing the company in 2018 \u2014 majorly complicating OpenAI\u2019s conversion.\n\nOriginally, OpenAI wanted to usurp its nonprofit from the throne and put its for-profit arm in charge of the entire company. It abandoned these plans in May, however, amid a lawsuit from Musk which tried to block the move, accusing the company of betraying its founding mission of pursuing AI for the benefit of humanity.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, had backed OpenAI with billions of dollars in crucial funding, and as a result earned exclusive rights to OpenAI\u2019s intellectual property and software, as well as an agreement to share revenue. It didn\u2019t want to lose these privileges in a restructuring without getting an even bigger stake in the company.\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention was artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical AI system that surpasses human cognition in virtually all areas. The old deal between Microsoft and OpenAI contained a vaguely worded \u201cAGI clause\u201d stipulating that if OpenAI achieved AGI, Microsoft would lose exclusive rights to the startup\u2019s tech. Microsoft saw this as a huge liability, while OpenAI saw it as an indispensable failsafe against its powerful benefactor.\n\nWith the conversion to a public benefit corporation, these issues have been put to bed, at least for the time being. In its own announcement, Microsoft said it will keep its access to OpenAI\u2019s tech if it ever achieves AGI \u2014 so long as it has \u201cappropriate safety guardrails\u201d \u2014 and that any declaration of achieving AGI will \u201cnow be verified by an independent expert panel,\u201d as The Verge noted. The revenue sharing will continue until the expert panel confirms AGI, and in the meantime Microsoft gets to pursue building AGI on its own, and have a 27 percent stake in the new PBC, which is one percent more than OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit holds.\n\nBut the biggest source of relief for OpenAI concerns its enormous investment from Softbank. The Japanese conglomerate agreed to shovel $30 billion into OpenAI, but only if it completed its restructuring by the end of year. If not, it would\u2019ve withheld about $10 billion of its pledged investment, funds that OpenAI simply can\u2019t afford to squander as it tangles itself in a web of centibillion-dollar deals with money flowing in all directions \u2014 including a just announced deal to buy $250 billion worth of Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service \u2014 not to mention its struggle to actually turn a profit.\n\nTechnically, the nonprofit arm remains in control of the company, but it\u2019s extremely doubtful that it will play anything more than a ceremonial role with the profit-making arm unleashed to raise more capital than ever. OpenAI can call itself a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d entity, but it hasn\u2019t shown much regard for the benefit of humanity with its environmentally destructive data centers or its psychologically damaging tech.\n\nMore on OpenAI: Serious New Hack Discovered Against OpenAI\u2019s New AI Browser",

      "full_text": "The ultra-conservative former congressman Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast has been elected as Chile\u2019s next president.\n\nWith more than 99% of polling stations counted, Kast took 58.16% of the vote, against 41.84% for the leftist Jeannette Jara, a former labour minister under the current president, Gabriel Boric.\n\nThe son of a Nazi party member, an admirer of the dictator Augusto Pinochet and a staunch Catholic known for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage, Kast built his campaign on a promise to expel tens of thousands of undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cHere, no individual won, no party won \u2013 Chile won, and hope won. The hope of living without fear. That fear that torments families,\u201d Kast told the thousands of supporters who waited more than two hours for his speech.\n\nMany analysts believe the ultra-conservative succeeded in addressing one of Chileans\u2019 main concerns: rising violence, which has increased in recent years even though the country remains one of the safest in Latin America.\n\nOver the past decade, the number of migrants has doubled, fuelled by about 700,000 Venezuelans forced to leave their country amid its economic collapse.\n\nKast repeatedly presented migrants as the reason for rising insecurity. During the campaign, he gave the roughly 330,000 undocumented migrants \u2013 most of them Venezuelan \u2013 an ultimatum to leave before the next president takes office on 11 March or be expelled \u201cwith only the clothes on their backs\u201d.\n\nIn his victory speech, in which he repeatedly said Chileans were living in \u201cfear\u201d, the president-elect said his administration would show \u201cgreat firmness in confronting all those who harm us\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen we tell an irregular migrant that they are breaking the law and must leave our country if they ever want the chance to return, we mean it \u2026 We must show great firmness against crime, organised crime, impunity and disorder.\u201d\n\nKast\u2019s platform included a Trump-inspired plan to build detention centres and five-metre-high walls, electric fences and three-metre-deep trenches, as well as an increased military presence along the border, particularly in the north, on the frontier with Peru and Bolivia.\n\nThis was Kast\u2019s third attempt at the presidency: in 2021, he was defeated by Boric in the runoff.\n\nIn a televised phone call, Boric congratulated Kast on \u201ca clear victory\u201d and invited the president-elect to a first meeting on Monday morning at La Moneda, the presidential palace in Santiago, to begin the transition.\n\nBoric said Kast \u201cwill at some point come to understand what the loneliness of power means, and the moments in which very difficult decisions must be made.\u201d\n\nAlthough Jara won the first round in November, Kast\u2019s victory had been widely anticipated by polls and because he was expected to inherit the votes of the other rightwing candidates, which far outnumbered those of the left.\n\nJara called Kast on Sunday to concede and, in a speech afterwards, said she did not want a divided country and that she would lead a \u201cconstructive\u201d opposition, but would \u201ccondemn any hint of violence, wherever it comes from\u201d.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday congratulated Kast, whose victory has added another right wing leader more closely aligned with Donald Trump in Latin America.\n\nUnder Kast\u2019s leadership, \u201cwe are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration, and revitalising our commercial relationship,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.\n\nArgentina\u2019s far-right president, Javier Milei, congratulated his \u201cfriend\u201d Kast with a post on social media: \u201cOne more step for our region in defence of life, liberty and private property. I am sure we will work together so that the Americas embrace the ideas of freedom and we can free ourselves from the oppressive yoke of 21st-century socialism.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s leftist president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, also congratulated Kast in a post and said he \u201cwill continue working\u201d with the Chilean government to strengthen relations between the two countries and to ensure \u201cthe preservation of South America as a zone of peace\u201d.\n\nAlthough many analysts see the result as part of a broader rightwing wave sweeping South America \u2013 with victories this year in Ecuador, Bolivia and Argentina\u2019s midterms \u2013 many Chilean analysts also view Kast\u2019s win as a continuation of the alternation of power between left and right since the country returned to democracy after the military dictatorship which lasted from 1973 to 1990.\n\nDespite his sweeping victory, Kast will not command an absolute majority in Congress, neither in the lower house nor in the Senate, even when counting all rightwing parties together.\n\nThe ultra-conservative has pledged to cut public spending by $6bn within 18 months, but has not explained how he intends to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are many things about what a Kast government will look like that we don\u2019t know because he has not said how he will do them,\u201d said Rossana Castiglioni, a political science professor at the Universidad Diego Portales.\n\n\u201cIn terms of economic policy, it is very likely we will see adjustment measures typical of the right. But we have no certainty about how he will implement them \u2026 where there is far less uncertainty is on security policy, because that has been his workhorse throughout the campaign,\u201d she added.",

      "full_text": "Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers.\n\nDuring an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see AI get even better,\u201d Hinton replied. \u201cIt\u2019s already extremely good. We\u2019re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It\u2019s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it\u2019s going to be able to replace many other jobs.\u201d\n\nHe added that AI\u2019s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before.\n\nThat means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month\u2019s worth of labor.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,\u201d predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker \u201cgodfather of AI.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology\u2019s dangers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably more worried,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it\u2019s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.\u201d\n\nIf an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained.\n\nTo be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he\u2019s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives.\n\n\u201cBut along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don\u2019t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,\u201d he warned.\n\nSome AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there\u2019s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing.\n\n\u201cThey may think there\u2019s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we\u2019re not going to not do that good,\u201d he said. \u201cFor driverless cars, they will kill people, but they\u2019ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.\u201d\n\nHinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work.\n\nIn October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper.\n\n\u201cI think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that\u2019s where the big money is going to be,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV\u2019s Wall Street Week.\n\nWhile some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level.\n\nA recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI.\n\nAnd in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system.\n\n\u201cIt will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,\u201d he told the Financial Times",
